## Installation instructions

To build ng2-store and the sample app locally, first do:

    npm install
    
This should install jspm, angular2 and immutable.js.
 
 
# TODO

 - fix toggle all
 - review buildTodos - it should be the responsibility of the action to return a new valid state, not the backend service 
 - synchronous actions can persist changes based on some middleware - onSuccess onError?
 - middleware mechanism
 - undo /redo 
 - tests
 
 - docs
 - typings
 - ensure cross browser support
