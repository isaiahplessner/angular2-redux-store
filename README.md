## Installation instructions

To build ng2-store and the sample app locally, first do:

    npm install
    
This should install jspm, angular2 and immutable.js.
 
 
# TODO
 
 - reserve npm name

 - middleware mechanism

 - undo /redo middleware?
 - tests
 - docs
 - typings


### If building the library and examples on Windows

Run the commands from either Cygwin or the [git bash shell](https://git-scm.com/downloads), which does not require administrator privileges.


## Having difficulties?

It would be great to open an issue, even if its simply a question. If running into issues, can you copy the whole error message and add the node and npm version and i'll follow it up. Thanks.
