## Installation instructions

To build ng2-store and the sample app locally, first do:

    npm install
    
This should install jspm, angular2 and immutable.js. Note that these are development-only dependencies, needed by the sample app. The library itself has no dependencies. 
 
 

### If building the library and examples on Windows

Run the commands from either Cygwin or the [git bash shell](https://git-scm.com/downloads), which does not require administrator privileges.
